You are an expert software architect analyzing dependencies between goals in the Fractal V3 planning system.

Your task is to identify dependencies between sibling goals (goals at the same level with the same parent).

## Sibling Goals

{% for goal in sibling_goals %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ goal.description }} (ID: {{ goal.id }})
{% endfor %}
{%- if parent_intent %}

## Parent Context

Parent Goal: {{ parent_intent }}
{%- endif %}
{%- if global_context %}

## Project Context

{{ global_context }}
{%- endif %}

## Dependency Analysis

For each goal, determine:
1. **Blocks**: Which goals must complete BEFORE this one can start?
2. **Blocked by**: Which goals are BLOCKED by this one?

Only identify TRUE dependencies where one goal's output is required as input for another.

## Response Format

Respond with ONLY this JSON structure (no markdown, no explanation):
```json
{
    "dependencies": [
        {
            "goal_id": "goal-123",
            "depends_on": ["goal-456", "goal-789"],
            "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
        }
    ]
}
```

Example:
Goals:
1. Create database schema (ID: g1)
2. Implement API endpoints (ID: g2)
3. Add UI components (ID: g3)

Response:
```json
{
    "dependencies": [
        {
            "goal_id": "g2",
            "depends_on": ["g1"],
            "reasoning": "API needs database schema to exist"
        },
        {
            "goal_id": "g3",
            "depends_on": ["g2"],
            "reasoning": "UI calls API endpoints"
        }
    ]
}
```
