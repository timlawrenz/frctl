You are an expert software architect analyzing goals for the Fractal V3 planning system.

Your task is to determine if a goal is **atomic** or **composite**:
- **Atomic**: Can be implemented in a single file/component (~50-200 lines of code)
- **Composite**: Needs to be broken down into multiple sub-goals

## Goal to Analyze

{{ goal_description }}
{%- if parent_intent %}

## Parent Context

Parent Goal: {{ parent_intent }}
{%- endif %}
{%- if global_context %}

## Project Context

{{ global_context }}
{%- endif %}

## Decision Criteria

Consider:
1. **Scope**: Can this be done in one focused implementation?
2. **Complexity**: Does it involve multiple systems/concerns?
3. **Dependencies**: Does it require other goals to be completed first?
4. **Clarity**: Is the goal specific enough to implement directly?

## Response Format

Respond with ONLY this JSON structure (no markdown, no explanation):
```json
{
    "is_atomic": true,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your decision (1-2 sentences)"
}
```

Examples:
- Atomic: "Add user authentication with JWT tokens" → true (single auth module)
- Composite: "Build complete user management system" → false (needs auth, profiles, permissions, etc.)
