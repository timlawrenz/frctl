# Tasks: Create CLI Structure

1.  ✅ Ensure the main `frctl` package directory exists at the project root.
2.  ✅ Create a `__main__.py` file within the `frctl` package to serve as the primary entry point.
3.  ✅ Add a `pyproject.toml` file to define the project metadata and dependencies.
4.  ✅ Define a console script entry point in `pyproject.toml` to make `frctl` runnable.
5.  ✅ Add a basic CLI framework (e.g., `click`) and a simple "hello world" command.
6.  ✅ Install the project in editable mode to verify the entry point.
