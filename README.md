# frctl (Fractal V3)

**A Deterministic Topological Architecture for Agentic Software Engineering**

Fractal V3 solves the "Context Coherence Crisis" in AI-driven software development by replacing linear reasoning chains with a graph-based, deterministic architecture.

## Overview

Frctl implements the Fractal V3 architecture - a system that transforms AI agents from erratic code generators into disciplined architectural planners through:

- **Federated Graph Architecture** - DAG-based dependency management
- **Tandem Protocol** - Human-in-the-loop planning workflow
- **Recursive Context-Aware Planning (ReCAP)** - Hierarchical task decomposition
- **Transactional Execution** - Safe rollback and drift resolution

## Documentation

See the [docs/](./docs/) directory for complete technical specifications:

- [Fractal V3 Architecture](./docs/fractal-v3-architecture.md) - Complete technical specification

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Run the CLI
frctl --help
```

## Project Status

🚧 **Early Development** - Currently implementing the core CLI structure based on the Fractal V3 specification.
